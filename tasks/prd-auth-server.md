# Product Requirements Document: Python Authentication & Authorization Server

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a centralized Python-based authentication and authorization server that will serve as the single source of truth for user authentication and access control across multiple applications. The server will handle user registration, login, JWT token generation, and role-based access control to enable secure access to protected resources across web applications, mobile apps, and APIs.

**Problem Statement:** Multiple applications need a centralized, secure way to authenticate users and control access to protected resources without implementing authentication logic in each application.

**Goal:** Create a high-performance, scalable authentication server that provides secure user management, authentication, and authorization services with minimal latency.

## Goals

1. **Centralized Authentication:** Provide a single authentication service for all integrated applications
2. **Secure User Management:** Enable secure user registration, login, and profile management
3. **OpenID Connect Implementation:** Provide industry-standard authentication and authorization protocols
4. **Role-Based Access Control:** Implement flexible authorization using roles and permissions
5. **Low Latency Performance:** Ensure sub-100ms response times for authentication operations
6. **Scalable Architecture:** Design for horizontal scaling to handle increased load
7. **Security Compliance:** Implement industry-standard security practices and protocols

## User Stories

1. **As a new user**, I want to register an account with a username and password so that I can access protected applications
2. **As a registered user**, I want to login with my credentials and receive a JWT token so that I can authenticate with other applications
3. **As a user**, I want to reset my password if I forget it so that I can regain access to my account
4. **As a user**, I want to view and update my profile information so that I can keep my account details current
5. **As an application developer**, I want to validate JWT tokens so that I can protect my API endpoints
6. **As an administrator**, I want to manage user roles and permissions so that I can control access to different resources
7. **As an application**, I want to check user permissions so that I can enforce access control on protected resources
8. **As a developer**, I want to integrate my application using OpenID Connect so that I can leverage standardized authentication flows
9. **As an application**, I want to use OAuth 2.0 flows to securely access protected resources on behalf of users

1. **Social Login:** Integration with social media platforms (Google, Facebook, etc.) is not required initially
2. **Advanced Analytics:** Detailed user behavior analytics and reporting are not required
3. **Mobile App SDKs:** The system will provide REST APIs only; mobile SDKs are not included

## Design Considerations

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** FastAPI (recommended for modern Python projects, excellent performance, automatic API docs)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for user data, roles, and permissions
- **Authentication:** OpenID Connect 1.0 protocol with JWT-formatted tokens
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** TOTP implementation using PyOTP library
- **OpenID Connect:** OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect implementation using Authlib library
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt or Argon2 for secure password storage
- **API Documentation:** Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation via FastAPI

### Architecture Patterns

- **RESTful API Design:** Follow REST principles for all endpoints
- **Layered Architecture:** Separate concerns into authentication, authorization, and user management layers
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract database operations for maintainability
- **Dependency Injection:** Use FastAPI's dependency injection for clean, testable code

### Database Schema Considerations

- Users table with secure password storage
- MFA configuration table for storing TOTP secrets and backup codes
- OAuth 2.0 clients table for OpenID Connect application registration
- OAuth 2.0 tokens table for token management and revocation
- Roles and permissions tables for RBAC
- User-role assignments table
- Audit logs table for security tracking (retention: 1 week)

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements

- **Response Time:** Authentication operations must complete in <100ms
- **Throughput:** Support at least 1000 concurrent users
- **Database:** Optimize queries with proper indexing on frequently accessed fields
- **Caching:** Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed user data and permissions

### Security Considerations

- **JWT Secret:** Use strong, randomly generated secrets for JWT signing
- **Token Expiration:** Implement reasonable token expiration times (e.g., 15 minutes for access tokens)
- **Password Policy:** Enforce strong password requirements
- **MFA Configuration:** Secure storage of TOTP secrets and backup codes with encryption
- **MFA Rate Limiting:** Implement stricter rate limiting for MFA endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement per-endpoint rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- **OAuth 2.0 Security:** Implement PKCE, validate redirect URIs, and secure client credentials
- **OpenID Connect:** Ensure ID tokens are properly signed and validated
- **Token Security:** Implement secure token storage, transmission, and revocation mechanisms

### Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design for multiple server instances behind a load balancer
- **Database Connection Pooling:** Implement efficient database connection management
- **Stateless Design:** JWT-based authentication enables stateless server design
- **Microservice Ready:** Structure code to potentially split into separate services later

### Configuration Management

- **Local Development:** Use .env files for configuration
- **Dev/Production:** Use environment variables for configuration management
- **Security:** Sensitive configuration (JWT secrets, database credentials) must be managed via environment variables
- **Validation:** Validate required configuration values at startup

## Design Decisions

The following decisions have been made to clarify implementation details:

1. **Token Refresh Strategy:** Applications will be required to handle refresh logic; the system will not implement automatic token refresh
2. **Permission Granularity:** Resource-level and action-level permission granularity will be implemented
3. **Audit Log Retention:** Audit logs will be retained for one week
4. **Error Handling:** Minimal error messages will be provided to end users, with developers receiving more detailed error information
5. **Health Checks:** Basic health check endpoints will be implemented for monitoring and load balancer integration
6. **Configuration Management:** Local development will use .env files, while dev/production environments will use environment variables
7. **MFA Enforcement:** Multi-factor authentication will be optional for all users
8. **MFA Recovery:** MFA backup codes will be provided for recovery in case of device loss

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting Strategy:** What are the specific rate limiting thresholds for different endpoints?

## MFA Backup Code Recommendations

Based on industry standards and security best practices, the following recommendations are provided for MFA backup codes:

- **Number of backup codes:** 10 backup codes (allows for multiple devices/locations and provides redundancy)
- **Expiration policy:** 1 year expiration (balances security with user convenience and reduces long-term risk)
- **Code format:** 8-character alphanumeric codes for easy manual entry
- **Regeneration:** Users should be able to regenerate backup codes, which invalidates all previous codes
