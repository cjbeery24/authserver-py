### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.py` and `MyComponent.test.py` in the same directory).
- Use `pytest` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- Database migrations should be run with `alembic upgrade head` after any schema changes.
